## 📊 Overview  

Citavi is an all-in-one solution for organizing academic research, managing references, and structuring scholarly writing projects. Created for students, researchers, and professionals, it integrates literature management, knowledge organization, and project planning into a unified workspace. This holistic approach makes it much more than a citation tool—it becomes a central hub for building, exploring, and refining complex research projects.

Users can gather sources from academic databases, library catalogs, websites, and journals with ease. Citavi automatically imports bibliographic metadata, allowing references to be stored, sorted, and categorized with precision. Its powerful filtering, searching, and tagging functions keep even large research collections manageable and well-structured across multiple disciplines.

A distinctive feature of Citavi is its deep integration of knowledge management. Users can highlight PDFs, extract key passages, create structured notes, and link insights directly to outlining elements within a writing project. This eliminates the chaos of scattered notes and ensures that every idea remains anchored to its source.

Citavi’s citation system provides hundreds of formatting styles and ensures accurate referencing for essays, theses, reports, and publications. Writers can insert citations directly into documents, enabling seamless bibliography creation and consistent formatting throughout.

The built-in project planner allows researchers to map tasks, deadlines, and goals, making it easier to manage long-term academic or professional work. Team-based research is supported through shared-project features, which allow multiple users to contribute to the same reference library or writing structure.

Whether for academic coursework, a dissertation, collaborative research, or professional documentation, Citavi brings clarity to every stage of the research lifecycle—from source collection to final output.
